			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How well has the communities act been followed in Massachusetts?</li>
				<p>I think the definition as presented on the website (https://www.mass.gov
					/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities#what-
					is-the-law?-) is a great place to start this analysis. The website contains
					definitions of all the terms used, and states all the requirements of 
					the law. This is the first step to understanding the problem - seeing
					what has been achieved till now and what is left.</p>
				<li>Does the presence of MBTA stops in a municipality correlate with 
					the household income level?</li>
				<p> I moved here two years ago and when I was looking for houses, it was 
					always advertised if a property was close to a T station. It made complete
					sense that these houses would have a higher rent since they are more in 
					demand. But if I think about who lives here, they are students with a 
					lower salary. Similarly, I know of working professionals who were able
					to drive from far to work everyday. This was the major motivation for
					me to explore this topic.
				</p>
				<li>Does the racial demographics (mostly white vs more diverse)
					affect whether there is more public transit in a municipality?</li>
				<p> This question was inspired by a reading I did for A1 (https://themarkup.
					org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-
					algorithms) I felt like there has got to be some relation between 
					certain communities which have historically been less diverse and people
					may have wanted to keep it that way, and this would show in one of the 
					ways people from diverse background transit for work - the MBTA. Hence
					I chose this question to go deeper.</p>

			<h2>Data Quality Assessment</h2>
			<p> I am using two datasets for this assginment. The first is the MBTA routes 
				and stops geojson dataset, and the second is the single family zoning vs other
				housing zoning geojson dataset.
			</p>
			<h3>MBTA routes and stops data</h3>
			<p>This dataset is from the GFTS and is well documented. It passed all my gut 
				checks - ferries were on the water, the subway system matched what I use 
				regularly. In terms of provider, it was the MBTA and Cape Cod Regional transport
				Since I am only looking at municipalities in the housing dataset, I decided 
				to exclude the one entry for Cape Cod in this analysis. I also do not include
				routes which go to Rhode Island. There were some null values for things like
				short names for routes, but the data had been cleaned up. 
			</p>
			<h3>Housing zoning data</h3>
			<p>This data was from the census for two different years, so the data for 
				population and the data for the incomes did not correspond to exactly the same
				set of people (but was close enough). I found the only_single_family field to 
				be a little hard to work with, expecially because it was grouped into two 
				categories often (for single and mixed with multi family housing), which caused
				the other data to also be split into two, but I was able to resolve it. I did see
				some discrepancies about things like the total populatin not adding up to the 
				sum of al the races, the latin american race having fractional values, the 
				household in income brackets not mactching the total households, but they 
				were minor enoguh for my analysis where I often took averages and looked at 
				the top X of a certain quantity.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<h3>How well has the communities act been followed in Massachusetts?</h3>
			<p>I found the MBTA communities act to be a good starting point for this 
				analysis. One of the requirements of this act is that an MBTA community should
				have atleast one district in which multi family housing is permitted which is
				not more than 0.5 miles away from a transit station.
			</p>
			<p>The first step was to filter all the municipalities by whether they are an MBTA
				community. Out of the 101 municipalities listed here, four were non listed 
				as MBTA communities, namely: Bolton, Boston, Hudson, and Milford. Out of those
				Bolton and Milford were only single family households.
			</p>
			<p> I then filtered by 'only single families' to look at municipalities where only
				single family zoning was permitted. This gives 57 such districts (44 had multi
				family housing). A visualisation is shown below
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/Sin_fam_zon.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Spatial distribution of the 57 municipalities in Massachusetts which are designated as MBTA communities
				and have only single family zoning. This is the first step to understanding which
				municipalities the MBTA communities act.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> In the next step I plotted the stops using the 'routes' attribute, plotting all 
				the stops led to a lot of overplotting, since I was potting the 0.5 mile buffer
				as well, and most of the districts shown here which were closer to Boston had 
				a good coverage in terms of the stops. So I looked at only the Commuter Rail
				stops which were spread further away from Boston. This image helps see how many
				of the municipalities do not have coverage from the 0.5 mile buffer area around a 
				transit stop, which would mean that they could not have atleast one district in 
				that buffer zone. The image is shown below. 
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/muni+stops.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Visualization showing the location of commuter rail stops overlaid on the 
				single family zoning MBTA communities. The stops have a buffer of 0.5 miles
				around them, within which, according to the communities act, atleast one
				district must lie in order to comply.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>From the image it is clear that there are several municipalities which are not
				in the vicinity of these buffer zones. I visually look at them and group them 
				into a set called 'violators'. This set contains 38 municipalities.
			</p>
			<p> One effect of these municipalities not being near a transit station is that
				if people want to go to another municipality, they need to use their own
				vehicle for atleast part of the way, and I wanted to understand if the people
				living there had the income to afford a car. For this, I looked at the income
				of the households in these municipalities - and focused specifically on what 
				percentage of households had the lowest listed income here - under $10000.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/low_inc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Treemap showing the relative percentage of very low income households (<$10000)
				among the 'violators' group defined as the municipalities which did not have
				a transit stop near them.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> Framingham is the municipality which has the highest percentage of very low income
				households among the 'vioators'. This and municipalities like Peabody and 
				Manchester would particularly benefit from being more connected to the MBTA
				transit routes, since the lower income households are less likely to be able
				to afford and use private vehicles.
			</p>
			<h3>Does the presence of MBTA stops in a municipality correlate with 
				the household income level?</h3>
			<p> The 'development' in transit oriented development implies that municipalities 
				which have a higher income in general, are likely to have had some of that 
				development come from the benefits of having transit stops there.
			</p>
			<p> The first thing I did was to create a new field called average household 
				income, which is made by taking a household weighted average of the middle income 
				from each group (i.e. take 12500 for inc1015). I then ordered them by this
				average income. I further try to look at the top 10 and the bottom 10 
				municipalities by grouping them together. They are shown below.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/10ncomes.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The top 10 and the bottom 10 municipalities by average income, calculated 
				as the weighted average of the income groups and the middle income from each 
				group.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>I first look at the 10 poorest districts, plot them spatially, and overlay
				them with all the stops in MBTA. There is quite some overplotting here,
				but the objective here is to see how well these municipalities are connected
				to the MBTA stops. The image is shown below.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/Poorest.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The 10 poorest municipalities as calculated by weighted average of the 
				household incomes, overlaid with all stops of the MBTA. The overplotting 
				gives an idea of the density of the stops near each municipality.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> From a first glance it is clear that most of these municipalities are very
				well connected to the MBTA. Even Ipswitch, which is the furthest away from 
				Boston, has the commuter rail stops for zone 6 and zone 7 present. This is
				a good sign, since access to public transport is more crucial for such
				municipalities where more development can take place, and people can avail
				a cheaper mode of transport than private vehicles.
			</p>
			<p> I then look at the top 10 wealthiest municipalities, according to the same
				definition of average household income. I plot them with all the stops of
				the MBTA, for a similar analysis. The visualisation is shown below.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/wealthiest.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The 10 wealthiest municipalities as calculated by weighted average of the 
				household incomes, overlaid with all stops of the MBTA. The overplotting 
				gives an idea of the density of the stops near each municipality.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> The wealthiest municipalities show an interesting difference from the poorest
				in terms of connectivity to the MBTA. Most notably, anticlockwise from the top,
				North Reading, Sudbury, and Sherborn do not have any MBTA stops in them.
				The inference from this is likely that a lot of households here use private
				vehicles to transit to other places, since they can afford it.
			</p>
			<p> This further asks the question about the demographics of these three municipalities,
				whether they are similar or different in any ways. For this, I try to tabulate
				the variables about types of household, poulation, and gender. A table is used
				since there are three things to compare across varied fields. It is shown below
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/3muni.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Table comparing three wealthy municipalities which are not well connected to the MBTA
				system, comparing them across types of household, population, and gender.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In terms of type of household,the three are quite varied. Sherborn has twice 
				the number of family households compared to non-family ones whereas North 
				Reading has five times more. Sudbury has about an equal number of family and 
				non family households. However, Sherborn and Sudbury are almost solely zoned 
				for single family homes whereas North Reading is not. The population dynamics
				seems almost similar for each of the municipalities, except for North 
				Reading having a proportionally lower number of older (above 65) people. 
				The surprising statistic about Sudbury is the significantly larger fraction 
				of women than men, whereas the ratio is mostly balanced for the other two. 
				An explanation could be the presence of women’s colleges there, which would 
				also explain the larger number of non family households. </p>
			<p> This preliminary analysis shows that the three municipalities are actually
				not as similar to each other apart from not being very connected by MBTA.
				They have likely deveoped due to different economic growth models.
			</p>
			<h3>Does the racial demographics (mostly white vs more diverse)
				affect whether there is more public transit in a municipality?</h3>
			<p> I next wanted to explore if there is any correlation between race and proximity
				to MBTA stops. The connection (if any) seems unlikely, and if there is one, it
				may indicate biases in houses being sold in terms of the race of the buyer.
			</p>
			<p> Among the municipalities, there was no populatio data for four - Somerville, 
				Everett, Chelsea, Burlington. I exclude these from my further analyses. I 
				create a calculated field - %White which calculates the percentage of white
				population in each region, and a higher number would indicate a less racially
				diverse demogaphic. I again select the top 10 most and least racially diverse 
				municipalities. They are shown below with the population of white people in 
				each.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/race.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The 10 most and 10 least racially diverse municipalities, calculated as the 
				percentage of white people in that region. From the image it is seen that 
				Randolph is the most racially diverse and Essex is the least racially diverse 
				municipality.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> I then again group them, and spatially plot them, overlaying them with the 
				MBTA routes. The 10 most diverse municipalities are shown below.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/diverse.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Spatial representation of the 10 most racially diverse municipalities in MA,
				defined as the municipalities with the lowest percentage of white people,
				overlaid with all the MBTA routes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> We see that most municipalities in this group are well connected by the MBTA
				network. Even hopkinton (bottom left) has one MBTA stop. I do a similar 
				analysis for the 10 least racially diverse municipalities in the list. 
				The visualisation is shown below.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/white.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Spatial representation of the 10 least racially diverse municipalities in MA,
				defined as the municipalities with the highest percentage of white people,
				overlaid with all the MBTA routes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> It is interesting to see that there are 4 municipalities (Essex, 
				Hanover, Marshfield, Duxbury) which do not have any routes running through
				them. If we look at MBTA stops, Topsfield and Danver also join this list, 
				bringing it to 60% of the top 10 least racially diverse populations.
			</p>
			<p> The racial distribution of these populations brings to light some biases 
				which may be prevalent about selling houses to people of certain races. It
				warrants more research into the concept of redlining, where people do not
				want more transit oriented development happening in their municipalities,
				for fear of more crowding of their neighborhoods due to people immigrating
				from different backgrounds.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Exploring Transit Oriented Development for Massachusetts was a very interesting
			   aspect of housing which I explored through this exercise. I wanted to look at
			   the MBTA communities act as a starting point, and then look into two more aspects
			   of income and race, and how they are affected by the transit. It was interssting
			   to note that 38 of the 101 municipalities do not follow the guidelines as stated
			   in the communities act, and the poorer regions like Framingham may particularly
			   benefit from TOD. In terms of income, I found that the 10 poorest municipalities
			   were pretty well connected by the MBTA, as compared to the 10 wealthiest 
			   municipalities, where 3 of them had no transit stops in them. I also found that
			   though the wealthiest municipalities did not correlate with the least diverse
			   and vice versa for poorer municipalities and more diverse population, there was 
			   a similar trend of the more diverse municipalities to be very well connected to
			   the MBTA, as compared to the municipalities where mostly white people lived,
			   which did not have routes or stops on them. This brings up the point about 
			   redlining and the possible reason that some communities did not want to have
			   transit oriented development which may get more migrant populations living 
			   in those areas.
