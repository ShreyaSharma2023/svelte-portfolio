			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The data shows a slowly increasing trend from mid March 2020 onwards
					and three more distinct peaks (and surrounding troughs) seen in Nov, Dec
					and Jan 2021 before declining to a minima in June, another maxima in Sep
					and decreasing with small peaks before an almost exponential rise in Jan 
					2022.
				</li>
				<li>At first glance it seems like the data for the two years 2020 and 2021
					almost has a 'lag'. Jun 2020 has a local minima whereas the minima in 2021
					is coser to July.
				</li>
				<li>It seems like Aug-Nov 2021 was the Delta variant peak and Dec 2022 onwards
					was the Omicron variant peak. I also tried to see if there is a correlation in
					the data and the swearing in of the new government in the US, in Jan 2021.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was curious about the need of a symmetrical visualisation about the two sides
					of the inner spiral radius, since the data did not encode any variable which could
					be shown on the two sides. The spiral helped in giving an idea about the continuous
					nature of the data and helped give insights about seasonal trends, but it also gave
					a false perception of depth due to the central focus point.
				</li>
				<li>The visualisation shows only the moving average of the new confirmed cases, but did
					not show the uncertainty or the projections the article talks about. The 
					commentary about the strain on hospitals due to varying severity of the different
					strains was not captured here. The important data was not intentionally 
					hidden, but the reader would subconsciously compare the number of cases to
					the radius of the circle, since they do not align on the same axis. As this
					is published in an online newspaper, people from all backgrounds are the 
					target audience, and the visualisation is simple enough for everyone to 
					understand when the next wave may peak.
				</li>
				<li>I think the takeaway message is still open to interpretation a bit, the 
					visualisation shows when and how much the peak is expected to happen, but 
					the article also has a discussion about effects of a vaccine, comparison to 
					other countries in similar and different seasons and the deadliness of the 
					variants along with hospital strains, so the reader may assume a need to take
					unnecessary caution since only the case numbers are presented. I wish the 
					names of all the months were written for completeness, and the 7 day average 
					label could have been mentioned elsewhere. The spacing feels deceptive, since
					the mind subconsciously compares the white space due to thickness of the 
					visualisation. Arrows make it clear where to begin reading.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>

		  three different years, split out by month of the year.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted the visualisation to be able to compare the number of cases (14 day sum)
					on an aligned scale (same radius), so that the seasonal/monthly trends 
					could be compared more easily.
				</li>
				<li>The peaks and troughs stand out more distinctly on first glance since they are on
					an aligned scale. However, the centre of the circle is too crowded and the scale 
					does not work well, since there is a lot of unused white space. I suspect this is
					what may have prompted the author to use a spiral template.
				</li>
				<li>I want to explore putting this data on a traditional rectangle graph, so that the 
					reader does not have to move their eyes around to comprehend it, and there is no 
					deceptive use of the radius of the circle.
				</li>
			</ul>

		  distributed by month, for three different years.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Here I compared the three years (14 day sum) as bar graphs, which gives
					the reader an idea of the trends between the months in each year,
					without having to put the extra strain of going around the circle.
				</li>
				<li>The thickness of the bar graph gives an illusion of area, which makes
					it easier to grasp. However, the colors do not look distinct enough, and 
					there is still crowding near the lower values of the y axis.
				</li>
				<li>The seasonal trend seems to play a factor in the number of cases, hence
					I would like to move away from using color, and focus on grouping cases
					by season and compare them for different years which would help people
					have a better idea of long term trends.
				</li>
			</ul>

		  experienced in the Northern Hemisphere, for three different years.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I used a human as a mark this time, to keep in mind the human issue at hand.
					The objective here was to group the trends by seasons in the Northern 
					Hemisphere, and quickly give some insight into the scale of the problem 
					without going into details of the fine small scale temporal trends
					
				</li>
				<li>There was visually lesser data on the chart, which was not as overwhelming
					for the reader, and the main message of the scale of the trends was conveyed. 
					I could have used more color for the different seasons and given more 
					hints as to how to read the chart
				</li>
				<li>To improve, I can try drawing the marks in the same pattern, i.e. x number
					of symbols on a line, since I sometimes found myself countign the number of 
					symbols, which could have been made more clear.
				</li>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>
      
			<figure>
				<img src="images/Final.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          Visualisation showing the 14 day moving average of daily COVID cases in the United
		  States. The data is for 3 years, arranged by week number. The variables shown are for new 
		  tested, confirmed, recovered and deceased cases, as well as calculated fields involving
		  fraction of confirmed cases [divided by new tested] and fractions of recovered or
		  deseased cases [divided by new confirmed].

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        Through the final visualisation, I am trying to give a more holistic picture of the covid
		crisis by comparing several differnt metrics. I want to compare the three years, since
		the seasons have an effect on people's activities as well as the natural cycel of infection,
		hence they are colored differently. I also want people to be aware of data about how much
		testing is being done (since the reading group article brought up some good points) and what
		fraction of that have confirmed cases, and also the fact that each confirmed case has two
		outcomes - either recovery or death. I want people to look at this graph and make conclusions
		abotut the differnt peaks, and vaccine efficacy (as shown by decreasing fraction of death over
		the years). I used the area chart for this since it is the easiest to view and contextualise in 
		terms of yearly data. Making several wide graphs was suitable due to the shape of the data 
		arranged in different months. I used darker hues for more recent years and used the same color 
		scheme across years for consistency. All of them were on a linear scale except for confirmed 
		fraction which was logarithmic due to the raneg of the data. As for the computed fractions,
		confirmed was [new confirmed] / [new tested] and recovered and deceased were [new recovered/deceased]
		 / [new confirmed] respectively. These transformations make an effetive argument since the 
		 reader can logically follow the outcome of a case. The visualisation does hide data about
		 testing in the later dates, specifically since testing in 2022 was very low, and coupled with 
		 data issues in the [new recovered] column made the [recovered fraction] not as reliable as 
		 the others.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The visualisation addressed most of my critiques of the original graph, like giving 
		the reader an easy way to compare yearly data across seasons, not being deceptive about
		different scales, and providing more context about the problem at hand, with the reader
		having the chance to look at trends and recovery rates, evaluate the efficacy of vaccines,
		look at the testing rates, etc. The three years can bee seen distinctly in different colors,
		and hence their reltive differences stand out clearly. However, it is far from perfect. There 
		were inconstencies in the logical flow I wanted to see clearly of testing -> Confirmed -> recovery
		or death due to the data collection method and there being some negative values present which I had 
		to exclude. The sheer amount of data present challenges in communicating this clearly, 
		especially when there are directives we want to give in terms of social distancing, masks etc. 
		I had to make tradeoffs about the scale of the problem, and the ease of comprehension of
		the problem, which is a critique I had of the original design which I wasn't able to resolve.
